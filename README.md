## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (compiled with VS code extension v6.1.2)
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Can't compile SCSS by 'npm install' (Node.js installed), in the end I just use VS code extension.

I find that SCSS make CSS less frustraing, but it's still frustrating. Still don't know how to make use of functions. 

And I think that this kind of layout should be easier with mobile-first workflow.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://github.com/thecodercoder/fem-dklt-toggle/blob/main/app/scss/util/breakpoints.scss) - This is for my own reference in the future: how to set up @media in SCSS.
